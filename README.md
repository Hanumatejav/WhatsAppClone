# WhatsAppClone

I made a simple WhatsApp clone for Mobile where you can see chats, statuses, and calls. For demo was just a single chat you can add more people by copying and pasting the particular code in the file and making the changes for profile image, chats and time in the chats section. The same can be also done with the status and call section. And add any photo yours choice in the project folder and name it has me or you can change the name as your change, then dont forget to change the name of the file in the project code also.

It May useful for you at the time of your Projects practises and helpful to enhance you skills.
